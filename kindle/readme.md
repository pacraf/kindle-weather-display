 I used information (and files) shared on:

from https://www.galacticstudios.org/kindle-weather-display/

you will find there a great tutorial "the easy way", that fit's also for me.

the difference is that on above server is based on php, in my case it is python, like oryginal project.

but the "kindle" part is far easier from above.
in fact you do not have to rrot kindle , just install kite with these files copied, and you start a script like it would be normal document.
