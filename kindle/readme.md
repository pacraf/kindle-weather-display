 I used information (and files) shared on:

from https://www.galacticstudios.org/kindle-weather-display/

you will find there a great tutorial "the easy way", that fit's also for me.

the difference is that on above server is based on php, in my case it is python, like oryginal project.

but the "kindle" part is far easier from above.
in fact you do not have to rrot kindle , just install kite with these files copied, and you start a script like it would be normal document.

**** NOTE for kindle 3 keyboard wifi - unfortunatelly from above link I cound not take directly scripts. 
I am linux newbie - so don't really know what is the problem, but figured out that 2>&1 was causing error in script execution, so the crontab was not changed at all. after removal of this from both scripts - it works. 

if you can explain what in fact is the problem - please post issue here...
