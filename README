Thanks for great idea and work of many people over internet, we can use old kindles as nice weather display devices. 

this fork is based on oryginal project, but:

- data source - OpenWeatherMap - using free plan api - means 5 days forecast
to use it, edit python file with your api key, and city id.

in my case it was neccesary to add on begining of python file some coding information (UTF-8), otherwise polish language characters were not
processed. 


server is running on orange pi zero (armbian) with added:
sudo apt-get install librsvg2-bin
sudo apt-get install pngcrush

I have to admit that librsvg2-bin was installed with some error at the end, but it works for this project anyway.

Because of laziness, my armbian on orangepi zero is serving weather file using already installed 'openmediavault' package.
That's why processed weather file is just moved to /var/www/openmediavault/
You should use your own server and path 

you can use cron to execute daily this script. In my case it is executed by Node-red instance running on my orange pi zero board.
