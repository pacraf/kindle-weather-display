Thanks for great idea and work of many people over internet, we can use old kindles as nice weather display devices. 
If you started with this idea/project to use kindle3 as weather display - I suggest, go and read source project, and few others (becasue there are many details)

this fork is based on oryginal project, but:

- data source - OpenWeatherMap - using free plan api - means 5 days forecast with 3hours step
to use it, edit python file with your api key, and city id.
It is worth to mention that the hard job of handling API is done by pyowm package.

in my case it was neccesary to add on begining of python file some coding information (UTF-8), otherwise polish language characters were not processed. This was only neccesary when running on armbian (on target system) , for developing on windows - it was working without them.

Target server part is running on orange pi zero (armbian) with added:
sudo apt-get install librsvg2-bin
sudo apt-get install pngcrush
pip install pyowm

I have to admit that librsvg2-bin was installed with some error at the end, but it works for this project anyway.
I tried to use ImageMagisk, as adviced soemwhere on net, but it has a bug and all icons are processed on the same coordinates. librsvg is doing the job just perfect
Because of laziness, my armbian on orangepi zero is serving weather file using already installed 'openmediavault' package.
That's why processed weather file is just moved to /var/www/openmediavault/ ( .sh script - you should use your own server and path) 

you can use cron to execute daily this script. In my case it is executed by Node-red instance running on my orange pi zero board. 


*********update

I don't know why, but during developing this project I observed that OWM forecast are far from precise. temperatatures durig winter time were prodicted o much lower than they happened to be. So I decided to give a try to another service dark sky.
now "ds" version is in testing.
