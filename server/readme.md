Here are two options.
if you like use OpenWeatherMaps (owm file)
or darksky (ds file)

I like ds because due to my personal impression, prediction fits better for my area.


icons I used in svg files are taken from mentioned in readme projects, and also from here

https://github.com/rickellis/SVG-Weather-Icons

(it is mix of them - depending which api was used. in general there is mix of them in svg preprocess file
